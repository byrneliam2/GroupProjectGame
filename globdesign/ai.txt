This package will be responsible for the enemies and allies of the player, it will likely extend the player class
and control the actions of an enemy using an algorithm rather than using keyboard controls. There will be essentially
two different types of enemies, ones which cause the player to take damage on collision and ones which shoot at the
player. Enemies will be different sizes as well.

I will likly use a strategy model and a finite state machine to model how enemies react in different situations.

Plan is to first implement 2 simple ai's an easy-to-do passive AI, which will stand in one place and not move
or attack you, and a simple enemy ai which will try keep a certain distance from the player, and periodically
shoot at the player.

Later plans are to implement 4 different levels of ai behaviours:

Enemies which try to keep a certain distance from the player and shoot slowly (Easy)
Enemies which move in a more random movement and shoot bullets at a medium pace (Medium)
Enemies which shoot fast and dodge some of the player's bullets (Hard)
Enemies which charge at the player attempting to swarm him. (Suicidal)
