This class will be responsible for the enemies and allies of the player, it will likly extend the palyer class 
and simply control the actions of an enemy using an algorithm rather than using controls.

I will likly use a strategy model and a finite state machine to model how enemies react in different situations.

Plan is to first implement 2 simple ai's an easy-to-do friendly AI, which will stand in one place and not move 
or attack you, and a simple enemy ai which will try keep a certain distance from the player, and periodically 
shoot at the player.

Later plans are to implement other different ai behaviours, for example:
Enemies which charge at the player attempting to swarm him.
Enemies which dodge player bullets
Enemies which run away from the player when they get low on health.
