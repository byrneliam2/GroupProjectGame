LIBRARY:
frames

DESCRIPTION:
The frames library will be responsible for holding the main Swing frame of the application and for generating and
displaying the correct screens (or "cards") at the correct times in the game. The MainFrame class will use a CardLayout
manager to flip between each card/screen of the game, including maps, main menus and the pause menu. The cards will
implement a superclass or interface which will be an extension of Swing JPanels.
