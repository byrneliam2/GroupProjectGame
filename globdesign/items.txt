Our game is going to have a few different types of items, items which you can EQUIP and items which you can USE.
All Items are either 'dropped' onto the map and must be picked up, or sold to you by Shopkeepers.

As a broad overview there are 4 different classes of item: healthPots, manaPots, Equipable items and keys.
Each item is stored in the backpack.

Keys:
These are one time use items which unlock a single door. (Potentially keys might be unique and only be able to open a specific door)

Equipable Items
Provide passive stat bonuses eg +10 health when equipped.

Health and ManaPots
One time use items which restore a certain amount of health.
