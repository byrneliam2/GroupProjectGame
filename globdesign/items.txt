Our game is going to have a few different types of items, items which you can EQUIP and items which you can USE.
All Items are either 'dropped' onto the map and must be picked up by the player, or sold to you by Shopkeepers.

As a broad overview there are 4 different interfaces of item: healthPots, energyPots, Equipable items and keys.
Each type of item is stored in different sections of the backpack.

Keys:
These are one time use items which unlock a single door. (Potentially keys might be unique and only be able to open a specific door).

Equipable Items
Provide passive stat bonuses eg +10 health when equipped.

Health and EnergyPots
One time use items which restore a certain amount of health or energy.

Note. Energy is something which we might not implement into the game but I thought it would be best to add functionality for it if
we later decide to implement it.
