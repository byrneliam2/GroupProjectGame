LIBRARY:
controller

DESCRIPTION:
The Controller Library is designed to listen to all Keyboard and Mouse Inputs / Movements
provided by the user. The library is designed with user preferences in mind, this will allow
for the user to specify their own desired key-binds for all the different actions the player
can perform in the game.

The Controller aim's to follow the MVC (Model/View/Controller) Pattern, therefore the View
will initialise the controller, and provide a pointer to the Model. Which will allow for
model manipulation, such as moving the character, to occur.

The Main Class of this Library is the "Controller" class, this will be called/created by the
View to initialise the Controller for use. This class will create a MouseListener and a
KeyListener, to monitor different inputs provided by the user and then feed those inputs to
the Model.
