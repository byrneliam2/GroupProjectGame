NOTES:
-All <x> <y> are TILE locations, not pixel locations.
-When making doors make sure they match up with the doors on the map.
-When making doors make sure that the door <id> is the same on doors on either side of the doors.





For Item:
<ItemName> (Must be the same name as one of the concrete classes in items package)
<x> <y> (Not sure how you are doing coordinates)

Example:
HealthPot
5 9




For npc:
<"Npc">
<EnemyName>-can't have spaces

<ControlScheme> <patrol leftRight(true/false)> <patrolNumber of tiles>
(NOTE. If the control scheme is not "PatrolScheme" then the two extra bits are useless but still have to be put in)

<x> <y> <health>

Example:
Npc
Yucky Bug
PatrolScheme true 5
1 1 2




For Door:
<"Door">
<mapName> <id> <locked(true)/unlocked(false)>
<x> <y>

Example:
Door
mapName 05 true
3 4

<"Key"> <id>
<x> <y>

Example:
