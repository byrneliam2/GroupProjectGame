TODO
- Integrate saving and loading
- Optimize drawing (associate items, etc. with images again?)
- External testing for all libraries (including MapCardTests)
- Get locked doors working for both images and backend
- Abstract out common interfaces: should all use common types!

- Add 'empty' hearts representing health lost
- Try get simple player animation working
- Test that keys and locked doors work
- (DONE) Add a dev-mode boolean which removes npc's from game (so we can run around easily)
- Fill out last 3 maps with npc/items
- Put in the sound effects for shooting, dying etc.

FIXME
- Tone down random item spawning, can currently get way too much armour
