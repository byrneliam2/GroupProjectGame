TODO
- Add game elements as to make an actual game (boss fight!)
- Integrate saving and loading
- Optimize drawing (associate items, etc. with images again?)
- External testing for all libraries (including MapCardTests)
- Get locked doors working for both images and backend
- Abstract out common interfaces: should all use common types!

FIXME
- Tone down random item spawning, can currently get way too much armour
