Design Notes for the map package:

-The player may not always be on one tile. So there should be a method that decides what tile the player is on "more" and that is the tile the player is one.
-Write a parser class that reads a map text file and creates a new map from it
-Enviroment's need to be in a text file and parsed as well, or at least put into a enum or something
-Make sure to setup exceptions
-Map parser includes items and NPC stuff
-Methods for map class
-Doors and if they are locked or unlocked, a locked door should reference a global boolean value in World, so when a player picks up a key the boolean is flipped and thus the player
can unlock the door. Think about door interactions.
-Movable objects, something to think about
