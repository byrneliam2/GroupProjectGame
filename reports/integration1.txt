INTEGRATION ONE REPORT

Today's integration had quite a few successes and failures. The combining of the two front end components
(view libraries and the controller setup) was successful, using simple print statement tests to confirm
communication. The integration of the model and the view was slightly hindered, however. Some difficulties
were had in trying to merge the different ideas that were proposed over how to display components on the
screen. The Map was originally going to be sent to the view as several collections of images which the view
would then process and display. One of these collections included the map background itself, which we have
decided to change, for ease of working, into one image rather than a collection of images representing partial
components of the map background. The other approaches have been kept, since drawing a set of items is easier
than layering another transparent image over top, especially when this image must be produced and updated
extremely rapidly. It has also been decided that the view will communicate with the model through a functional
interface class so that the view does not invade the model's implementation space. The in-between class will
function like a reference "atlas", where it will provide explicit middleman channels to the resources the view
requires of the model, such as image or location queries. The original idea involved the view "grabbing" what it
needed straight from the model, which is a violation of the modularity we aim to achieve with the use of libraries.
