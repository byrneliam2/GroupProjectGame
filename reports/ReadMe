This is group 10's read me for the external testing section of this group assignment
James:
I am in charge of externally testing gfx,audio and save/load packages.
-At this stage of the project the save/load functionality is still under development so externally testing it is
impossible at this point.
-I have added a few tests to the audio package and have stated in more detail in the tests itself what i did
and what i thought of the current tests.
-For graphics

Liam:
I have written some external tests for the items package, these can be found in the test class aptly named so.
All tests from items can be run with the AllItemsTests class.
Please note that not all the tests may pass, since items is undergoing a major redo currently.
