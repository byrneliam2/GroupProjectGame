CODE REVIEW DISCUSSION

Our code review was a successful endeavour. The game team is divided in front and back end developers, and so to
embrace this setup, the code reviewers were other developers working in the same end of the project.

The front end was modified greatly, with changes to how the view draws some of the elements on the screen being the
most prevalent modification. The controller was completely revamped to allow easy key binding and the use of a common
interface across the majority of the individual components.

In the backend...

Map: 
The Map package was reviewed by Tom, he thought it was done in a pretty neat way with different "layers" representing different 
parts of the map. The maps were also designed in a pretty awesome map editor which meant that they were all the same 
theme and they all look great! Some of the methods havent been fully tested but that's great as it gives us something to do.
Some improvements to possibly implement might be to split the class up into a few subclasses so that we don't have a giant subclass.
Also putting all the item parsing methods into a single class so that we can more easily add items is something we plan to do in 
future.

SaveLoad:
The saving and loading features haven't been implemented yet, however the planned method of using serialisation makes this quite an easy 
task as we simply have to turn the Game (and potentially all its subclasses, not sure yet) into a byte stream and then save the byte stream 
to a file.
