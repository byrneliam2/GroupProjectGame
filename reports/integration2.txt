INTEGRATION TWO REPORT

The second integration within our project was significantly better than the last. In the front end,
the audio and display libraries were integrated and tested with a variety of small test tracks.
This proved to be successful, with music playing during the menu's running. This will be improved
with optimized access to audio tracks and manual settings for the user.

In the back end, we organised exctly which methods we would need in the two main libraries of Player and Map. 
This proved successful and we beleive once all the methods are fully implemented, the game will be able to be played well
Methods added to the Map class were mostly 'check' methods that will allow the Player to check certain attributes, 
such as whether the Player can move onto a location.
Methods added to the Player class were mostly communication methods, which allow the controller to interact easily with the 
Player.
We also added a "wrapper" class to the back end which covers all the BackEnd libraries and gives a few methods which allows 
the front end to easily get all the different lists of entities that need to be drawn.

LIBRARY TESTING

In order to test each component of the game in isolation, test suites will be required to be package
private. That is, each library has its own tests package which will have limited to no access from
the outside. Most likely, the configuration will be <package>.tests. JUnit suites will be a tool to
use for this, as it helps to combine multiple test classes into one executable.
