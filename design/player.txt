This Player package will store informations on the player and performs methods on it.
This class will be containing a datastructure or a package to store the items which
are on the map so based on that we now there is an interaction between the Player package
and the Map package. 
Also, Thomas will likely extend the player class and control the actions of an 
enemy using an algorithm rather than using keyboard controls.

Also, This Player package will store informations about the name of the player.
Also, the Player package will be containing Actions such attacking, moving, picking up an item and etc.

Later plans are to implement 3 different levels of ai behaviours:
    A player should be able to attack an enemy or a boss in the map(Easy).
    A player Should be able to pick up items from the current frame(Easy).
    A Player Should be able to make a move to the adjacent Cells (Easy).
