LIBRARY:
gfx

DESCRIPTION:
The gfx library will be in charge of loading and hosting all images and other graphical entities that can be manipulated
by the game model directly. It will work closely with the frames library to produce a View that is capable of loading
separate screens and display moving images and other components (such as text and highlights.)

Images will be accessed through other entities in the game. Each component that can be drawn only knows what image
represents it. not how it is drawn. Therefore, the gfx library uses image file-path getters from each resource in order
to remove confusion about what should be drawn as what.
