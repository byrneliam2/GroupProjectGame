First of all we will be having a Specific folder just to store all the saving games.
This Save&Load package will be responsible to store all the current infromations
on the map in a text file, so we need to get all the different locations for 
players, enemies, items and etc. Also, When you want to load a game it goes through
saved.txt file and it reads it all and put it in the Map.


These are the libraries that I am going to use to make this class. :)
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
