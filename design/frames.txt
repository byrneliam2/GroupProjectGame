LIBRARY:
frames

DESCRIPTION:
The frames library will be responsible for holding the main Swing frame of the application and for generating and
displaying the correct screens (or "cards") at the correct times in the game. The MainDisplay class will use a CardLayout
manager to flip between each card/screen of the game, including maps, main menus and the pause menu.

ScreenCards will hold information about each screen of the game, including images that need to be generated (in cooperation
with the gfx library), buttons/locations that can be interacted with and other GUI attributes/functions. There will be
multiple types of cards, for example menu cards and game map cards. These will be different in how they use GUI
utilities, and so it is likely that they will use the Strategy pattern to accomplish complex tasks.

The cards will implement a superclass or interface which will be an extension of Swing JPanels, and as such the
MainFrame will hold a collection of cards to flip between, all referenced by supertype. Cards will be stored in the
cards package of the library.

The frames library, along with the gfx library, will comprise the View portion of the MVC pattern that this game will
be based upon.

NEW ADDITIONS:
- The frames library will reference the map (model) through an explicit channeling class
