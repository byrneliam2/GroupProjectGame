Map library: Will represent a given map in the world. The map library is "core" to the project
as may of the other API/library's in this project will rely on the map library for functionality, as such the map will
contain allot of methods that deliver important information.

The map is central to the project as it controls the flow of the game and what objects go where, e.g. If the player wants to move to the right,
it would have to check with the map that the spot it wants to move to can be moved over.

Each map is made up of multiple layers. Each layer being a series of 32x32 pixel "tiles" that represent a single spot on the map. Each layer works
together to form the map. E.g. Layer one could be the background layer and represent the graphics of the map, while layer two could be the
collision layer which marks which tiles can be moved over by entity's. At this point i have decided upon four core layers that will make up the map.

Each map will have:
+Background layer, represents the background graphics
+Collision layer, contains information on what tiles entities can move over
+Item layer, contains all the items on the map
+Enviromental layer, contains information on what tiles have enviromental affects that manipulate entities

The map will also contain collections of all the objects that can be located on a map, as well as
storing the locations of some of the objects, such as items.

NEW ADDITIONS:
- No more "tiling" of background images
