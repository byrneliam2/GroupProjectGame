LIBRARY:
audio

DESCRIPTION:
The Audio Library is designed to play all of the background music and sound effects that
occur at different portions of the game. The user will be able to modify the audio levels
of the Master, Background Music and Sound Effects separately, allowing for the user to
change these values to their desired sound levels.

The Audio Library will be standalone, and will be created by the View section of the MVC.
Therefore when the Model sends a request for a sound effect to be played, the View will
pass on the request, and an sound event will occur.

The Main Class of this Library is the "AudioHandler" class, this will be called/created by the
View. Whenever the View is required to relay a sound event, the event will be passed onto
this class. The "AudioHandler" will be relying on Multiple Threads to play different sound
effects at the same time, and these Threads can be closed on request or after the sound
file finish's playing.

An "AudioTrack" class will allow for different classes to create sound events, this class
will contain all the required information for an Audio File to be played. The class will
contain fields holding: Sound-File Location and Track Type (Music/Sound Effect), which
will determine how "AudioHandler" handles the sound event.
